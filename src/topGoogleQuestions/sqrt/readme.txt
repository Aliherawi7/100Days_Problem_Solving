### 28. Sqrt(x)

description:
compute and return the square of x, where x is
guaranteed to be a non negative integer.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal
digits are truncated and only the integer part
of the result is returned.

Example 1:
input: 4
Output: 2

Example 2:
input : 8
Output: 2
explanation: the square root of 8 is 2.82842...,
and since the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.
