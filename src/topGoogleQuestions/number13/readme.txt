### 13. Search in Rotated Sorted Array


description:
Suppose an array sorted in ascending order
is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.
(i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

you are given a target value to search. if found
in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.
Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the
order of O(log n).

Example 1:
input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
output =  4

Example 2:
input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
output = -1
