descriptions:
Given an array of integers and an integer k, find out
whether there are two distinct indices i and j in the
array such that num[i] = num[j] and the absolute
difference between i and j is at most k.

Example 1:
input: nums = [1,2,3,1], k = 3
output: true

Example 2:
input: nums = [1,0,1,1], k = 1
output: true

Example 3:
input: nums = [1,2,3,1,2,3], k = 2
output: false
