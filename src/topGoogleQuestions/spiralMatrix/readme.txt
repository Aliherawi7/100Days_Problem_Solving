Example 1:

input:
[
    [ 1, 2, 3 ],
    [ 4, 5, 6 ],
    [ 7, 8, 9 ]
]

output: [1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5]

Example 2:

input:
[
    [1, 2, 3, 4],
    [5, 6, 7, 8],
    [9,10,11,12]
]

output: [1, 2, 3, 4 ,8, 12, 11, 10, 9, 5, 6, 7,]

Example 3:

input:
[
{1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6},
{16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 7},
{15, 24, 23, 22, 21, 8},
{14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9}
]
output:
