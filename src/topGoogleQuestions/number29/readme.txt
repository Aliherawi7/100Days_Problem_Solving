### 29. Search a 2D Matrix

descriptions:
Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value
in a m x n matrix. this matrix has the following properties.
Integers in each row are stored from left to right.
The first integer of each row is greater the last integer of
the previous row.

Example 1:
Input:
matrix = [
[1, 3, 5, 7],
[10, 11, 16, 20],
[23, 30, 34, 50]
]
target = 3
output : true

Example 2:
Input:
matrix = [
[1, 3, 5, 7],
[10, 11, 16, 20],
[23, 30, 34, 50]
]
target = 13
output : false
