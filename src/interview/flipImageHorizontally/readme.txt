### Flip the image Horizontally

descriptions:
Given an n x n binary images, flip the image horizontally then invert and
return the resulting image
To flip an image horizontally means that each row of the image is reversed.
for example, flipping  [1, 1, 0] horizontally results in [0, 1, 1]
To invert an image means that each 0 is replaced by 1 and  each 1 is replaced by 0
for example inverting [0, 1, 1] results in [1, 0, 0]

ex:
input : {[1,1,0], [1,0,1], [0,0,0]}
output:{[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,1,]}
