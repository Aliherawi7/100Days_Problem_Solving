### 4. Rotation of String

descriptions:

Given a string s1 and a string s2,
write a function to check whether s2 is a rotation of s1.
A string is said to be rotation of another string, if it
has the same length, contains same characters, and they
were rotated around one of the character.
for example, string "bcda" is a rotation of "abcd" but
"bdca" is not a rotation of string "abcd"

Example 1:
input = "abcd", target = "bcda"
output = true
